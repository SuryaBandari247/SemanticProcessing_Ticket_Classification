# Semantic Processing - Ticket_Classification Case Study
> For a financial company, customer complaints carry a lot of importance, as they are often an indicator of the shortcomings in their products and services. If these complaints are resolved efficiently in time, they can bring down customer dissatisfaction to a minimum and retain them with stronger loyalty. This also gives them an idea of how to continuously improve their services to attract more customers.  

These customer complaints are unstructured text data; so, traditionally, companies need to allocate the task of evaluating and assigning each ticket to the relevant department to multiple support employees. This becomes tedious as the company grows and has a large customer base.

## General Information
### Problem statement
> As a financial company, the firm has many products and services such as credit cards, banking and mortgages/loans. 
We need to do topic modelling on the .json data provided by the company. Since this data is not labeled, we need to apply NMF to analyze patterns and classify tickets into the following five clusters based on their products/services:

* Credit card / Prepaid card
* Bank account services
* Theft/Dispute reporting
* Mortgages/loans
* Others 

## Steps
Below steps needs to be completed:

* Data loading
* Text preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Feature extraction
* Topic modelling 
* Model building using supervised learning
* Model training and evaluation
* Model inference

## Technologies Used
- Jupyter notebook - version 6.4.12
- Python - version 3.10.0
- Pandas - version 2.0
- Numpy - version 1.24.2
- sklearn - version - 1.2.2
- seaborn - version - 0.12.2
- NLP
- NLTK
